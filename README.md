## Findings
* Generally, a movie's financially success is negatively correlated to how restricted it is to general audiences.
* Comedies and family films are the most common types of films distributed. These types of films are also the most successful financially liekly due to these films being made from heavy-hitters like Pixar and Disney.
* Action and Adventure are both genres that are associated with many live-action blockbusters yet aren't as impactful financially in the animated world with the former making on average 47% less money in the box office compared to comedies. 
* While films of niche genres like Biography, War, and Documentary are often rated highly on IMDb, these films are poor contenders for box-office success.
* As the means of making and watching animated films gradually increases, so will the amount of movies that are being made.

## Recommendations / Next steps for research
* Further investigate the correlation in the type of animation to its financial success. In other words, look into subcategories like anime, 3d, claymation, etc. to see how expensive / profitable they are. 
* Develop a better understanding on the monetary impact of streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Max to the animation industry.
* Better understand how a movie's success may differ across different regions? Is a certain type of movie more likely to succeed in North America than in Europe and vice versa for example?
* Dive deeper into the use of celebrities versus specialized voice actors and their impact on the movie's success.
